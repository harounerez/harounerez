## 🧠 About Me

I am an **AI & Data Science Engineering student** at the **National Higher School of Artificial Intelligence (ENSIA, Algeria)**. My mission is to build robust, intelligent systems inspired by the research culture at places like DeepMind, FAIR, and CMU.

My current focus is on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for industrial knowledge systems. I am passionate about pushing boundaries in:
* Large Language Models (LLMs) & Generative AI
* Medical Image Analysis & HealthTech
* Vision-Language Systems
* AI for Education and Social Good

I am actively seeking **research collaborations** and **AI engineering internships** to help build the next wave of intelligent systems.
